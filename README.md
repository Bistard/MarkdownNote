## üåéWhy Me?
> * *Nota* is a free and open-sourced project. Rich text based note-taking application is not really my thing, that is why I choose Markdown (plain text) as the only way to store our data. 
> * For users who do not know about Markdown, don't worry about it because *Nota* provides a great user experience that makes you can work just like the others.
> * You can access all your data freely at any time because it is stored in your local disk.
> * Since the data and *Nota* have no longer binding to each other, you may use any cloud services to store your data.
> * You don't need to worry about what happens to your data if *Nota* no longer being updated after 10 years. All you need to do is use another markdown editor to open your local data.
> * *Nota* supports all the basic writing functionalities from Markdown. If you require more advanced note-taking skills, go try the other rich text applications.

## üëÅ‚Äçüó®Screenshots
> * The current (2022.11.05) UI design is far away from GOOD.
> 
> * Since we haven't come up with a perfect UI design for *Nota*, we are still working on the foundation (backend) of the applications. That is why the screenshot has not been updated for a while.
> * If you are good at software UI design, you are welcome to contact with me!

## üì¶Architecture
> * First of all, by reading the goodness of vscode source code, *Nota* decided not to use any existing frameworks, instead we are basically building everything from the scratch. If you read the source code of *Nota* carefully, you may find that there are some similarities compared to vscode.
> * Secondly, there are lots of functionalities that are separated into tons of microservices which are managed by our own DI system (Dependency Injection) to achieve the idea of IoC (Inversion of Control).
> * Thirdly, some places are built by the idea of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), one of them is how we display our tree-like structure.
> * There should be more to be disscussed, but I guess I will stop from here and do some code now.
