## üëÅ‚Äçüó®Screenshots
> * The current (2022.11.05) UI design is far away from GOOD.
> 
> * Since we haven't come up with a perfect UI design for *Nota*, we are still working on the foundation (backend) of the applications. That is why the screenshot has not been updated for a while.
> * If you are good at software UI design, you are welcome to contact with me!

## üì¶Architecture
> * First of all, by reading the goodness of vscode source code, *Nota* decided not to use any existing frameworks, instead we are basically building everything from the scratch. If you read the source code of *Nota* carefully, you may find that there are some similarities compared to vscode.
> * Secondly, there are lots of functionalities that are separated into tons of microservices which are managed by our own DI system (Dependency Injection) to achieve the idea of IoC (Inversion of Control).
> * Thirdly, some places are built by the idea of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), one of them is how we display our tree-like structure.
> * There should be more to be disscussed, but I guess I will stop from here and do some code now.
